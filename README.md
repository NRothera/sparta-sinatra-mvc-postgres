# sparta-sinatra-mvc-postgres

Sinatra Web Application using Posts as the resource.

The database was filled using a seed file.

Manually wrote all the restful routes to get an understanding of how it works.

Also manually wrote all class and instant methods for the post model in order to understand what goes on behind the scenes for Ruby on Rails
